Background During the pandemic, there has been a surge of new investors who trade on low-cost platform such as RobinHood. Dangerously, investors are not very aware of the history and nature of the stock market. This application will allow users to simulate portfolios under an investment strategy and, more meaningfully, show the distribution of returns on different investment strategies over a large sample size. Users can then compare the expected outcomes of the conventional and proven investment strategies and determine which one is most suited to their financial needs.

Functionality & MVPs In Investment Strategy Simulation, users will be able to:

Select between four investment strategies (value, growth, momentum, dollar-cost averaging)
Construct randomized portfolios based on the selected investment strategy
Track the performance of the portfolio over a given period of time
Compare the performance of the portfolio to a passively-managed index fund comprising all the stocks in the marketplace weighted according to market capitalization
See the distribution of portfolio performance across all strategies to form investment strategies (e.g. which strategy is most likely to outpeform the market and generate alpha)
In addition, this project will include:

A brief explanation of the statistics generated by the project to help users understand what their implications are
A brief explanation of the different investment frameworks that have been accepted in modern economics
A production README
Wireframes

There will be four investment options to choose from at the top and pressing an option will append the option to the chart (if the option is already on the chart, it will be removed instead)
On the upper-right, there will be a investment horizon button that sets the period a user can see his/her portfolio over
Also on the upper-right, there will be a portfolio button that renders all the portfolios the user has created and allow the user to see individual portfolio and stock performance
On the upper-left, the users can input how many stocks (the extent of diversification) they want to add to their portfolio
Technologies, Libraries, APIs This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

Alpha Vantage API to access stock information
Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
npm to manage project dependencies
Implementation Timeline

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get Alpha Vantage API working. Determine the quantitative characteristics of each investment strategy. Map out the logistics for constructing a portfolio.
Monday: Be able to render, remove, and overlap graphs on the webpage
Tuesday: Be able to show individual portfolio and stock performance
Wednesday: Figure how to create the display for distribution of investment strategies
Thursday Morning: Submit project
